## **Project Description**

This website has been built to improve on the current, existing squarespace website for Black Rose Tattoo, I have undertaken this project as the shop belongs to a good friend of mine, also I have a passion for tattoos and this is the studio that I go to.
I wanted to create this website to improve on the aesthetics and accessibility for information about Black Rose Tattoo, its tattoo artists and booking appointments.

[YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/43350-should-visible-tattoos-be-allowed-workplace) wrote an article about tattoos and the workplace, which showed that a 1/4 of Britons have tattoos and this is likely to keep growing with the acceptance of tattoos becoming a more widespread global opinion in recent years.

## User Experience UX

- ### User Stories

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the site and find the content I want without difficulty.
        2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to book in easily.
        3. As a first time visitor, I want to have initial tattoo questions answered on a page so I don't have to contact anyone first.
        4. As a first time visitor, I would like to view current/existing work by the artist.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily and quickly find to contact details again.
        2. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to gain quick access the artists' up-to-date work.

* #### Frequent Visitor Goals

        1. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to see if any new artists have been added to the studio.

- ### Design

- #### Colour Scheme

  I initially chose a colour scheme of grey and pink but once I had applied the colours early on I decided that it did not work and did not provide the look I was going for. I then found a colour palette of shades of teal which I have used and also added to with selections of my own, complimented with gold accents, with black and white details to provide the necessary distinction between background and content.
  All colours are displayed within a commented section of my css so that if you need to change anything, you can make the changes in this section and it will apply to the classes, some of which cover repeated elements throughout the website.

  I have used #013636 for the background of the navigation and footer elements.
  Using a slightly lighter teal, #006666, for the background of all pages to distinguish the difference between header, footer and main section of the webpage.
  All text and icons are in white to ensure this is easily visible to the user.
  I have used #011d1d for the page titles, I made this a little darker, again to really make the text distinguishable.

- #### Typography
  Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use on the site.

  - For the Page Title I have used the google font [Pirata One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pirata+One?query=pirata+one) Pirata One is a font that is close to black lettering which is a calligraphy style commonly used by tattoo artists.

  ![Pirata One Font Example](documentation/pirata-one-example.png)

  - I have also chosen [Montserrat](documentation/montserrat-example.png) as my other font, which is clear and easily readable.

- #### Imagery

  - This is an important aspect of this website as tattoo's are a visual commodity, images will showcase the studio and also examples of the artists work. The main image on the home page gives the user a sneak peak at the tattoo studio before setting foot in the physical location.

- #### Wireframes

  - Home Page Wireframes [Desktop](documentation/wireframes/home-wireframe.png) [Mobile](documentation/wireframes/home-mobile-wireframe.png)
  - FAQ Page Wireframe [View](documentation/wireframes/faqs-wireframe.png)
  - Contact Us Page Wireframe [View](documentation/wireframes/contact-us-wireframe.png)
  - Booking In Page Wireframe [Desktop](documentation/wireframes/book-in-wireframe.png) [Mobile](documentation/wireframes/book-in-mobile-wireframe.png)
