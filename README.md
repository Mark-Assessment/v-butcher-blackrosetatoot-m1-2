# **Black Rose Tattoo**

Visit the deployed website: [Black Rose Tattoo]()

## **Project Description**

This website has been built to improve on the current, existing squarespace website for Black Rose Tattoo, I have undertaken this project as the shop belongs to a good friend of mine, also I have a passion for tattoos and this is the studio that I go to.
I wanted to create this website to improve on the aesthetics and accessibility for information about Black Rose Tattoo, its tattoo artists and booking appointments.

[YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/43350-should-visible-tattoos-be-allowed-workplace) wrote an article about tattoos and the workplace, which showed that a 1/4 of Britons have tattoos and this is likely to keep growing with the acceptance of tattoos becoming a more widespread global opinion in recent years.

## User Experience UX

- ### User Stories

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the site and find the content I want without difficulty.
        2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to book in easily.
        3. As a first time visitor, I want to have initial tattoo questions answered on a page so I don't have to contact anyone first.
        4. As a first time visitor, I would like to view current/existing work by the artist.

        1. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily and quickly find to contact details again.
        2. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to gain quick access the artists' up-to-date work.

        1. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to see if any new artists have been added to the studio.

- ### Design

- #### Colour Scheme

  The main colours used will be grey and pink, this follows the company's aesthetic and branding of being female owned and has been used on the previous site, providing some familiarity to anyone who uses the website already.


- #### Typography
  Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use on the site.

  - For the Page Title I have used the google font Pirata One. Pirata One is font close to black lettering which is a calligraphy style commonly used by tattoo artists. 

  - I have chosen Pirata One, Oswald and Montserrat as my fonts, with a back up of sans-serif if those fonts do not work.

- #### Imagery

  - This is an important aspect of this website as tattoo's are a visual commodity, images will showcase the studios, artists work and also artists themselves.

- #### Wireframes
